wait-before-heal
	-explosions :

block-per-block : 
	-enabled :
		(true or false) Whether the blocks destroyed by the explosions should all pop back at once, or one at a time.
	-interval

crack-destroyed-bricks : 
	(true or false) Whether bricks destroyed should be replaced as cracked ones.

chest-protection: 
	(no, lwc, lockette or all) no: nothing particular. lwc: blocks protected by lwc will not blow up. lockette: blocks protected by lockette will not blow up

------------------------------------------------------
TRAPS
------------------------------------------------------

Traps are TNT blocks that are automatically replaced along with their explosion's damage. Thus, the trap is reset. It allows for hidden TNT behind a wall, or pressure plates under the snow... Feel free to experiment!

1. Set up a trap.

Set a TNT block wherever you want. Look at it and type "/ch trap create". You should have sufficient permission for that (either of those nodes : CreeperHeal.* CreeperHeal.trap.* CreeperHeal.trap.create). Now, whenever this block explodes, it will pop back along with the rest of the blocks destroyed. And it is protected from getting destroyed by angry players!

2. Remove a trap.

If you are the owner of a trap, it's simple. Either look at it and type "/ch trap remove" or simply destroy it! You should of course have at least the node CreeperHeal.trap.remove.own, or CreeperHeal.trap.remove.all, or any of the wildcard (*) nodes.
If you're not the owner of the block, same procedure, but not the same permissions. This time you HAVE to have CreeperHeal.trap.remove.all, or any of the wildcard nodes.
