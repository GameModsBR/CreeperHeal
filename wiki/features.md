Features
====

Almost very feature listed is configurable.

### Terrain healing
*    Heals terrain damage from explosions, block per block. Blocks are replaced from bottom up, the furthest ones first.
*    Configurable delay before replacement of an explosion starts, and speed at which it replaces the blocks
*    Supports Creepers, Ghast, TNT, dragons, fire, Wither, and all other types of explosions (from other plugins)
*    Block Endermen from picking up blocks.
*    Restores the land exactly as it was before, with the paintings, the chests (full and protected if they were protected), the colored wool, etc...
*    Configurable limit under which not to replace damage (explosions, fire).
*    Configurable black-list/whitelist of blocks to drop instead of replace.
*    The sand and gravel don't fall after an explosion, so the terrain is still the same.
*    Teleports the suffocating players to safety when they are trapped in an explosion healing.
*    Choose if the new blocks should overwrite the old ones, or the contrary, when someone built on the site of an explosion.
*    Crack those bricks! Stone bricks destroyed can come back as cracked!
*    You can drop the blocks that get destroyed, with a chance percentage.
*    You can configure obsidian to have a chance to be destroyed.
*    Prevent silverfish from destroying their spawning block when reacting to an attack. The block is instead replaced by its natural equivalent.
