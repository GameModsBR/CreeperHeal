CreeperHeal
=======

[Project page][project]

Protects your server against Creepers, TNT, and griefers! 

CreeperHeal is more than a griefing protection plugin : it repairs the damage done by explosions (Creepers, TNT, etc...) and fire, in a natural way! Stay a while after a Creeper made a hole, and you will see the terrain pop back slowly, block per block, exactly as it was before the explosion! That way, your players will still be afraid of Creepers, but your server will continue looking nice!
* **Natural healing of the terrain after an explosion**
* **Fully customisable**
* **Easy installation and configuration**
* **Anti-Griefing features**

Here's a sample [fan-made video][video].

NOTE : This is not an official video, but one made by a fan. An official one will be posted in a while.
